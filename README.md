# MutltiseriesDataPreparation
A notebook showcasing data preparation in a multiseries time-series dataset

In this notebook we explore the preparation of a multiseries dataset representing the sales of a department store across 24 different departments. The features in the dataset describe sales as a function of the size of each department, number of employees, percentage of merchadise on sale and on promotion, marketing events, local events that can attract crowds to the vicinity of the store, and macroeconomic indicators such as consumer price index, GDP, and percentage change in US unemployment insurance claims.

The dataset presents several challenges such as missing timestamps, missing values, and different starting and end dates for each of the series in the dataset. We will address these issues, and we, perhaps more interestingly, we will also inspect the data to identify similarities across the Sales series that could indicate the presence of clusters.
